                  Claims made by leaders of major national parties, ministers in the central government &amp; on official government websites are monitored. Only those claims that can be fact checked are selected i.e., those that have a definitive claim and not just a vague statement. Adequate care is also taken to ensure that there is no political bias in terms of selection and equal importance is given to claims made by leaders of different parties.

                  Once the claim is established, research is undertaken, primarily using government data/information sources, to fact check the claim. Relevant data/information is presented in the form of tables, charts etc. to corroborate the fact check. The fact check is not just limited to the claim made, but also looks at historical data to look at trend over time etc. We also look at relevant policy changes over time. The relevant data/information from official sources is also hyperlinked in the fact check story.                  </p>
